# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing food delivery application with comprehensive address management and favorites functionality. The enhancement introduces event-driven architecture using EventBridge for address events and SQS for favorites processing, along with dedicated DynamoDB tables and API Gateway endpoints following OpenAPI specifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Address Management Service

**User Story:** As a food delivery customer, I want to manage my delivery addresses so that I can easily select from saved addresses during checkout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new address THEN the system SHALL store the address in DynamoDB and publish an address-created event to EventBridge
2. WHEN a user updates an existing address THEN the system SHALL update the address in DynamoDB and publish an address-updated event to EventBridge
3. WHEN a user deletes an address THEN the system SHALL remove the address from DynamoDB and publish an address-deleted event to EventBridge
4. WHEN a user retrieves their addresses THEN the system SHALL return all addresses associated with their user ID
5. IF an address operation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses with status codes

### Requirement 2: API Gateway with OpenAPI Specification

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the food delivery system, I want well-documented REST APIs so that I can easily understand and consume the address and favorites services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Gateway is deployed THEN it SHALL expose RESTful endpoints for address management (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
2. WHEN the API Gateway is deployed THEN it SHALL expose RESTful endpoints for favorites management (GET, POST, DELETE)
3. WHEN developers access the API documentation THEN they SHALL see complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification with request/response schemas
4. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate requests against the OpenAPI schema
5. IF invalid requests are received THEN the system SHALL return 400 Bad Request with validation details

### Requirement 3: EventBridge Integration for Address Events

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want address changes to trigger downstream processes so that other services can react to address modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an address is created, updated, or deleted THEN the system SHALL publish structured events to the custom EventBridge bus
2. WHEN events are published THEN they SHALL include event type, user ID, address ID, and relevant address data
3. WHEN Lambda functions are configured as event consumers THEN they SHALL receive and process address events
4. IF event publishing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with the primary operation
5. WHEN multiple consumers exist THEN each SHALL receive the same event independently

### Requirement 4: Favorites Management with SQS

**User Story:** As a food delivery customer, I want to save my favorite restaurants and dishes so that I can quickly reorder items I enjoy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a favorite THEN the system SHALL send a message to the SQS favorites queue
2. WHEN a user removes a favorite THEN the system SHALL send a removal message to the SQS favorites queue
3. WHEN favorites messages are processed THEN the system SHALL update the favorites DynamoDB table
4. WHEN a user retrieves their favorites THEN the system SHALL return all favorites associated with their user ID
5. IF SQS message processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry according to configured retry policies

### Requirement 5: DynamoDB Tables for Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a system, I need reliable data storage for addresses and favorites so that user data persists across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the address table is created THEN it SHALL have user_id as partition key and address_id as sort key
2. WHEN the favorites table is created THEN it SHALL have user_id as partition key and favorite_id as sort key
3. WHEN data is written to tables THEN it SHALL include appropriate timestamps and metadata
4. WHEN queries are performed THEN they SHALL use efficient access patterns with proper indexing
5. IF table operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with appropriate retry logic

### Requirement 6: Lambda Event Source Mappings

**User Story:** As a system, I need Lambda functions to automatically process SQS messages so that favorites operations are handled asynchronously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SQS messages arrive THEN the configured Lambda function SHALL be triggered automatically
2. WHEN Lambda processes messages THEN it SHALL handle both single and batch message processing
3. WHEN message processing succeeds THEN the message SHALL be deleted from the queue
4. IF message processing fails THEN the message SHALL be retried according to configured policies
5. WHEN maximum retries are exceeded THEN messages SHALL be sent to a dead letter queue

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing Food Delivery System

**User Story:** As a food delivery customer, I want the new address and favorites features to work seamlessly with existing order functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN placing an order THEN users SHALL be able to select from saved addresses
2. WHEN viewing order history THEN users SHALL be able to add items to favorites
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN existing order functionality SHALL remain unaffected
4. WHEN new services are added THEN they SHALL follow the same authentication and authorization patterns
5. IF integration points fail THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully without breaking existing features
